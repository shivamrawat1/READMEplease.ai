Hello so this is AndroAccess It's an accessible solution for visually impaired individuals So it accepts any form of educational content whether it be PDF image picture video or just plain text and it converts them into accessible content form Let's start with the text example So I'll say hello or I'll give a smiley and I can convert it into audio or braille So let's convert it into braille first and it will show a braille output right over there And if it was a lowercase letter and it would have a different braille to correspond to that And if we want to convert the text to audio it will have it

Yeah and we can also do something similar with a PDF or a TXT file So we have the PDF and we want to upload and extract the text So it populates all the text we have over here and it can convert the same thing into braille and in the same format that it is in the PDF it preserves the format
